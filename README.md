# 🛡️ AuthPress

A **full-stack Role-Based Post Management System** built with the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**.  
It features **secure authentication, authorization, and fine-grained permission management** for multiple user roles — **Admin, Sub-Admin, Editor, and User**.  

Users can create, edit, and manage **posts, categories, comments, and likes**, while the access to each action is strictly controlled through **role-based access control (RBAC)**.
